Requires at least: 2.5
Tested up to: 2.8.x
Stable tag: 0.8

== Description ==

**Tweefind.com** WordPress plugin automatically adds at the bottom of your blog posts (no homepage, but **single pages only**) the most relevant tweets related to your posts'
content. The plugin actually searches Tweefind.com for tweets related to *first keyword* you use to tag your post. This behavior will be improved in the next versions. 

Tweets are added **live**, so if new tweets coming from users with higher rank (provided by Tweefind.com) come out, the tweet/tweets displayed *will be replaced* with the new ones. You can pause the auto-update by pressing the pause button at anytime or you can deactivate it from the admin panel.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Q: I don't want that horizontal scrollbar!
A: If a horizontal scrollbar appears, make sure that the width you set is big enough otherwise you  can try to use the "small" version of the widget, by setting the appropriate parameter on the admin panel.

Q: I don't want that vertical scrollbar!
A: If a vertical scrollbar appears, make sure that the height you set from the admin panel is big enough.
